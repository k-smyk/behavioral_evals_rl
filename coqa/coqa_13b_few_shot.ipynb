It has been described as gentle, clever and friendly. Yet not all Labs are the same. \\n\\nJohn Grogan discovered _ after he and his wife adopted a Labrador that they named Marley. The dog caused Mr. Grogan a lot of trouble, but it also provided many stories for his newspaper articles. Later, he wrote a best-selling book, \\\"Marley and Me: Life and Love with the World's Worst Dog.\\\" \\n\\nMarley was happy and fun-loving. But he was also extremely large and difficult to control. He bit anything that he could find around the house, including plastic, clothing and jewelry. And he had a great fear of loud noises, especially thunderstorms. Unfortunately, the Grogans lived in Florida where many thunderstorms develop. Marley would attack the furniture, walls and doors until his feet bled if he was left alone in the house during a thunderstorm. Marley almost damaged their home several times. \\n\\nJohn Grogan said that at first he considered that probably his dog could be trained to be a show champion. But he soon realized that was impossible. Marley didn't like to learn skills that didn't belong to dogs, and he was driven out of the dog training school for causing troubles for other dogs. He didn't want to hide his emotions. He would show his anger and tiredness if he felt them. \\n\\nEven if that, Marley still had earned a place in the Grogans'. He didn't know how to dance, and he didn't know how to walk on its two legs, but he was what he was. He would never be a Lassie or a Benji or an old Yeller for he would never like to take part in a dog show, but the Grogans accepted him and loved him very much.\",\n          \"Luna the hawk wanted some socks. It was the middle of winter and sitting on tree branches made her feet very cold. Luna hoped that her friends could help her find some socks. She flew to the old maple tree where Olive the owl lived. \\n\\n\\\"Olive, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?\\\" she asked. \\n\\nOlive the owl looked surprised. \\\"Luna, I have no use for socks because my legs and toes have thick feathers. Go visit one of the animals that walk on four legs. They might have extra socks you could borrow.\\\" \\n\\nLuna flew across the field and landed next to the icy creek. Rose the raccoon was teaching her six babies how to wash their paws. The water was very cold, but the babies were having fun. \\n\\n\\\"Rose, my bare legs and bare toes are so cold, may I please borrow a pair of your socks?\\\" begged Luna. \\n\\nRose laughed hard. \\\"Silly Luna, I do not have socks. Look at my legs and feet. They are covered with thick, warm fur. I'm sorry I cannot help you. Go visit the humans. Sometimes I tip over their garbage cans at night when I am looking for food. Once I saw a pair of socks.\\\" \\n\\nLuna was very afraid of humans. Her grandmother and mother had warned her about them. She was told that some humans are mean and hurt hawks. Her feet were so cold that it was difficult to grip tree branches. She became brave. She flew to the farmhouse on the big hill. When she landed on the roof, she could not believe her eyes. She saw socks! In late autumn, Henrietta the human had put laundry outside to dry and she had forgotten to bring in one tiny pair of socks. The socks were hanging on the clothesline by two wooden pins. Luna used her powerful beak to break the pins. She put on the socks and then flew back to her home in the huge tree. When she landed, her feet were warm and dry. Luna was very happy.\",\n          \"CHAPTER XXV. THE VELVET COACH \\n\\n\\n\\nNo, my good Lord, Diana-- ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL \\n\\nA late autumn journey from the west coast to Paris was a more serious undertaking in the sixteenth century than the good seaman Master Hobbs was aware of, or he would have used stronger dissuasive measures against such an undertaking by the two youths, when the elder was in so frail a state of health; but there had been a certain deceptive strength and vigour about young Ribaumont while under strong excitement and determination, and the whole party fancied him far fitter to meet the hardships than was really the case. Philip Thistlewood always recollected that journey as the most distressing period of his life. \\n\\nThey were out of the ordinary highways, and therefore found the hiring of horses often extremely difficult. They had intended to purchase, but found no animals that, as Philip said, they would have accepted as a gift, though at every wretched inn where they had to wait while the country was scoured for the miserable jades, their proposed requirements fell lower and lower. Dens of smoke, dirt, and boorishness were the great proportion of those inns, where they were compelled to take refuge by the breaking down of one or other of the beasts, or by stress of weather. Snow, rain, thaw and frost alternated, each variety rendering the roads impassable; and at the best, the beasts could seldom be urged beyond a walk, fetlock-deep in mire or water. Worse than all, Berenger, far from recovered, and under the heavy oppression of a heartrending grief, could hardly fail to lose the ground that he had gained under the influence of hope. The cold seemed to fix itself on the wound on his cheek, terrible pain and swelling set in, depriving him entirely of sleep, permitting him to take no nourishment but fragments of soft crumbs soaked in wine or broth--when the inns afforded any such fare--and rendering speech excessively painful, and at last unintelligible. \"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"questions\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"answers\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":5}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def make_prompt(df, index, turn):\n","  prompt = df[\"story\"][index] + \"\\n\\n\\n\\n\"\n","  for i in range(turn + 1):\n","    if i > 0:\n","      prompt = prompt + df[\"answers\"][index][\"input_text\"][i - 1] + \"\\n\\n\"\n","    prompt = prompt + df[\"questions\"][index][i] + \"\\n\\n\"\n","  return prompt"],"metadata":{"id":"g4-pgH-rEnQB","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711290623953,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":8,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}}},"execution_count":6,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_df = pd.DataFrame()\n","\n","for index, row in df.iterrows():\n","  for turn, question in enumerate(row[\"questions\"]):\n","    prompt = make_prompt(df, index, turn)\n","    completion = row[\"answers\"][\"input_text\"][turn]\n","    data = {\n","        \"prompt\": [prompt],\n","        \"completion\": [completion]\n","    }\n","    temp_df = pd.DataFrame(data)\n","    prompt_df = pd.concat([prompt_df, temp_df], ignore_index=True)"],"metadata":{"id":"XuhSp1HVEtoy","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711290630472,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":6525,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}}},"execution_count":7,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["def make_n_examples(n, df):\n","  header = \"You are supposed to answer the last question in a conversation about a topic.

From morning till night, he had a number of clear duties, for which Williams had patiently trained him and, like a good pupil, Prince lived for the chance to prove his abilities. When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. \"Boots\" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark. \n","\n","Williams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- \"days\", \"late days\", or \"nights\". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. \n","\n","A curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand. Very muddy, and wet through, the wallet still contained fifty-three pounds.\n","\n","\n","\n","What is the dog's name?\n","\n","Prince\n","\n","Who is his owner?\n","\n","Williams\n","\n","Is the dog wild?\n","\n","no\n","\n","Where does the dog go every morning?\n","\n","the general store\n","\n","Why does he go there?\n","\n","to get the daily paper\n","\n","What time does he go?\n","\n","nine\n","\n","What happens when Williams oversleeps?\n","\n","Prince barked at the bedroom door\n","\n","What happened to Williams last winter?\n","\n","he lost his wallet\n","\n","Was it ever found?\n","\n","yes\n","\n","Who found it?\n","\n","Prince\n","\n","\n","\n","Now it is your turn to answer and please keep it succinct.\n","\n","\n","\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_df.head(15)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":520},"id":"cX2CwK6BE-zV","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711290630478,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":21,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}},"outputId":"5d777f93-603f-4d5e-bd4e-9430f1c0a67f"},"execution_count":11,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               prompt  \\\n","0   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","1   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","2   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","3   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","4   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","5   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","6   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","7   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","8   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","9   Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","10  Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","11  Once upon a time, in a barn near a farm house,...   \n","12  Once there was a beautiful fish named Asta.

Try Christian Bale. \\n\\nThough in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old \\\"Dark Knight\\\" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- \\\"You will never see me at a party,\\\" he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. \\n\\n\\\"I make up [things],\\\" he told Details magazine earlier this year. \\\"Absolutely. I'm an actor -- I'm not a politician. I always kick myself when I talk too much about family, or personal things.

The studio, like CNN, is a unit of Time Warner.) \\n\\n\\\"Can he stand the glare of the spotlight?\\\" a rival studio executive asked Entertainment Weekly. \\\"Being put in major roles and major films?\\\" \\n\\nAlready there are signs that Bale has made the jump from actor to movie star. Last week, news of an alleged hotel-room tussle between the actor, his mother and his sister made headlines around the world.

I wanted a bunch of different vegetables, so I planted seven tomato plants, three pepper plants, six corn plants, and two cucumber plants. My mom loves zucchini so I also planted ten zucchini plants. I watered the garden daily with a watering can. When weeds started to take over, I pulled them back. About a month in, I started getting fresh vegetables every day. I walked to the garden with a big basket every morning and picked the vegetables that were ready. Sometimes I ate them right off the vine. One day I walked down to the garden and saw that the zucchini plants were taking over. Each of my ten plants had many zucchini, giving me hundreds of zucchinis each week. I didn't know what to do with the zucchini so I gave some to my neighbor. I gave some to my parents to take to their friends.

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted. Oink was really thankful, and next time he saw the birds, gave them their own pair of shoes for free as a thank you gift.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat was Oink?\\n\\na pig\\n\\nWhere did he live?\\n\\non a farm\\n\\nDid he make hats in a factory?\\n\\nno\\n\\nWhat did he make?\\n\\nshoes.\\n\\nWhat did he do in his free time?\\n\\nhe'd draw\\n\\nWhat was the subject of his drawings?\\n\\nhe wished to fly\\n\\nDid he dream about it?\\n\\nYes\\n\\nWhat did he get with a star sticker on it?\\n\\na letter\\n\\nWhere did it invite him?\\n\\nthe clouds\\n\\nWhat was happening in the clouds?\\n\\na party\\n\\nWhat would happen if he went?\\n\\nhe'd get wings so he could go\\n\\nHow many days did it take to get his wings?\\n\\nTwo\\n\\nWhat kind of animals did he see when he arrived at the party?\\n\\nhorses, dogs, cats, and birds\\n\\nWho invited everyone?\\n\\nthe birds\\n\\nWhy?\\n\\nso other animals could see what flying was like\\n\\nWhat did the birds say when they saw how much he liked flying?\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 5706,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Sturmarii\",\n          \"Likely.\",\n          \"a tickle\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":11}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_df[\"prompt\"] = prompt_df[\"prompt\"].apply(lambda x: example + x)"],"metadata":{"id":"jXemEL_vncd5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711290630802,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":341,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}}},"execution_count":12,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_df.head(15)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":520},"id":"yuZdcFCdn7PY","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711290631107,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":645,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}},"outputId":"ba174108-0ff3-492e-a716-e6db81e80300"},"execution_count":13,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                               prompt  \\\n","0   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","1   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","2   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","3   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","4   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","5   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","6   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","7   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","8   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","9   You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","10  You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","11  You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","12  You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","13  You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","14  You are supposed to answer the last question i...   \n","\n","                      completion  \n","0                          white  \n","1                      in a barn  \n","2                             no  \n","3   with her mommy and 5 sisters  \n","4               orange and white  \n","5                             no  \n","6            she painted herself  \n","7                     the farmer  \n","8          they started laughing  \n","9              a bucket of water  \n","10               licked her face  \n","11                            no  \n","12                         Asta.  \n","13                      a bottle  \n","14                         Asta.

From morning till night, he had a number of clear duties, for which Williams had patiently trained him and, like a good pupil, Prince lived for the chance to prove his abilities. When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. \\\"Boots\\\" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark. \\n\\nWilliams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- \\\"days\\\", \\\"late days\\\", or \\\"nights\\\". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. \\n\\nA curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand. Very muddy, and wet through, the wallet still contained fifty-three pounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the dog's name?\\n\\nPrince\\n\\nWho is his owner?\\n\\nWilliams\\n\\nIs the dog wild?\\n\\nno\\n\\nWhere does the dog go every morning?\\n\\nthe general store\\n\\nWhy does he go there?\\n\\nto get the daily paper\\n\\nWhat time does he go?\\n\\nnine\\n\\nWhat happens when Williams oversleeps?\\n\\nPrince barked at the bedroom door\\n\\nWhat happened to Williams last winter?\\n\\nhe lost his wallet\\n\\nWas it ever found?\\n\\nyes\\n\\nWho found it?\\n\\nPrince\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it is your turn to answer and please keep it succinct.\\n\\n\\n(CNN) -- He armors himself, keeps other people guessing and likes to wear a mask. \\n\\nChristian Bale is known as a hard worker who immerses himself in his characters. \\n\\nBatman? Try Christian Bale. \\n\\nThough in his case the armor and mask are metaphorical, the 34-year-old \\\"Dark Knight\\\" star likes to keep his personal life as shadowy as a superhero's back story. He's been known to keep a low profile -- \\\"You will never see me at a party,\\\" he told the Times of London -- and delights in concocting stories about his life. \\n\\n\\\"I make up [things],\\\" he told Details magazine earlier this year. \\\"Absolutely.

In his free time, he would make drawings about how much he wished he could fly. He would look up at the stars in wonder, hoping that some day, his dream might come true. For many years, his life carried on this way. He would wake up on the farm, go to work, and then come home to dream about flying. That is, until one day, he got a letter with a strange sticker on it, that was shaped like a star. He opened the letter in excitement, wondering what it said. The letter said that Oink was invited to a special party that took place every year in the clouds. Animals from all across the world were chosen so that they could know what it's like to fly. If he chose to go to the party, he would get his own set of wings to fly up into the sky and meet the other animals. Oink was so happy, he barely knew how to react. He accepted the invitation, and two days later, got a package containing his wings. Oink's dream was finally coming true. He put the wings on his back and flew up into the sky, where the party was being held. Once he arrived, he saw a bunch of other animals with wings also. He saw horses, dogs, cats, and plenty of birds. Oink had found out that it was the birds who had invited everyone, since they wanted the other animals to know what it is like to fly. Oink spent that day flying in the clouds with his new friends. But when the clock reached midnight, he knew his time flying was up, and he had to return the wings and go back to his farm. But the birds told him that they saw how much he enjoyed flying, and would allow him to keep his wings so he could fly with them whenever he wanted.

The borough is separated from New Jersey by the Arthur Kill and the Kill Van Kull, and from the rest of New York by New York Bay. With a 2016 Census-estimated population of 476,015, Staten Island is the least populated of the boroughs but is the third-largest in area at . Staten Island is the only borough of New York with a non-Hispanic White majority. The borough is coextensive with Richmond County, and until 1975 was the Borough of Richmond. Its flag was later changed to reflect this.

The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character.

He was 69. \\n\\n\\\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,\\\" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. \\\"Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues.\\\" \\n\\nFarina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, \\\"Thief.\\\" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as \\\"Miami Vice\\\" (in which Farina played a mobster) and \\\"Crime Story\\\" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). \\n\\nFarina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including \\\"Midnight Run\\\" (1988), \\\"Get Shorty\\\" (1995), \\\"The Mod Squad\\\" (1999) and \\\"Snatch\\\" (2000). \\n\\nIn 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running \\\"Law & Order\\\" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff \\\"Trial by Jury.\\\" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. \\n\\nFarina was on \\\"Law & Order\\\" for two years, partnered with Jesse L.

From morning till night, he had a number of clear duties, for which Williams had patiently trained him and, like a good pupil, Prince lived for the chance to prove his abilities. When Williams wanted to put on his boots, he would murmur. \\\"Boots\\\" and within seconds the dog would drop them at his feet. At nine every morning Prince ran off to the general store in the village, returning shortly not only with Williams' daily paper but with a packet of Williams' favorite tobacco. A trained gun-dog, Prince had a large soft mouth specially evolved (;) for the sake of carrying hunted creatures, so the paper and tobacco came to no harm, never even showing a tooth mark. \\n\\nWilliams was an engine driver, and he had to work at irregular times -- \\\"days\\\", \\\"late days\\\", or \\\"nights\\\". Over the years Prince got to know these periods of work and rest, and knew when his master would leave the house and return and _ If Williams overslept, Prince barked at the bedroom door until he woke. On his return, Williams' slippers were brought to him, the paper and tobacco too. \\n\\nA curious thing happened to Williams during the snow and ice of last winter. One evening he slipped and fell on the icy pavement somewhere between the village and his home. He was so badly shaken that he stayed in bed for three days; and not until he got up and dressed again did he discover that he had lost his wallet containing over fifty pounds. The house was turned upside down in the search, but the wallet was not found. However, two days later, Prince dropped the wallet into Williams' hand. Very muddy, and wet through, the wallet still contained fifty-three pounds.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhat is the dog's name?\\n\\nPrince\\n\\nWho is his owner?\\n\\nWilliams\\n\\nIs the dog wild?\\n\\nno\\n\\nWhere does the dog go every morning?\\n\\nthe general store\\n\\nWhy does he go there?\\n\\nto get the daily paper\\n\\nWhat time does he go?\\n\\nnine\\n\\nWhat happens when Williams oversleeps?\\n\\nPrince barked at the bedroom door\\n\\nWhat happened to Williams last winter?\\n\\nhe lost his wallet\\n\\nWas it ever found?\\n\\nyes\\n\\nWho found it?\\n\\nPrince\\n\\n\\n\\nNow it is your turn to answer and please keep it succinct.\\n\\n\\nKendra and Quinton travel to and from school every day. Kendra lives further from the bus stop than Quinton does, stops every morning at Quinton's house to join him to walk to the bus stop. Every afternoon, after school, when walking home from the bus stop they go in for cookies and milk that Quinton's mother has ready and waiting for them. Quinton can't eat cheese or cake so they had the same snack every day. They both work together on their homework and when they are done they play together. Kendra always makes sure to leave in time to get home for dinner. She doesn't want to miss story time which was right before bedtime. \\n\\nOne morning Kendra walked up to Quinton's house, she thought something might be wrong because normally Quinton was waiting outside for her and on this morning he was not to be found. Kendra went up to the door and knocked. She waited and waited and yet no one answered. She saw that Quinton's mother's car wasn't in their driveway which was weird. She waited for a few bit looking up and down the block and getting worried when Quinton was nowhere to be found. \\n\\nKendra didn't want to miss the bus to school and hurried off to make it in time. The bus driver saw that she was upset and that Quinton was not with her that morning. She told him what happened and he said that he was sure that everything would be okay. \\n\\nKendra got to school, ran to her teacher and told him what happened that morning. The teacher smiled and told her not to worry, Quinton's mother had called and he was going to the dentist and would be at school after lunch and that she would see him at the bus stop like normal tomorrow.\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere do Quinton and Kendra travel to and from every day?\\n\\nschool\\n\\nDoes Quinton live further from the bus stop?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nWhat do they do every afternoon after school?\\n\\ngo to Quentin's house\\n\\nDoes Quinton eat cheese?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nDo they play before their homework?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nWhat does Kendra not want to miss?\\n\\nstory time\\n\\nWhen is that?\\n\\nright before bedtime\\n\\nWhat happened when Kendra knocked on Quinton's door?\\n\\nno one answered\\n\\nDid she see the car?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nDid she miss the bus?\\n\\nNo\\n\\nWhat did the bus driver see?\\n\\nthat she was upset\\n\\nDid Kendra tell him why?\\n\\nyes\\n\\nWhat did he say?\\n\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"completion\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 71,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"mother\",\n          \"white\",\n          \"her teacher\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"log_prob\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 1.9773723774360905,\n        \"min\": -13.672323226928711,\n        \"max\": -0.013540592044591904,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 91,\n        \"samples\": [\n          -2.1204965114593506,\n          -2.865065813064575,\n          -0.17961256206035614\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":17}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"uoKY5a94I9-h","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711292771133,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":18884,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}},"outputId":"e57e6697-46cd-4a1b-e8f3-6ab74542a152"},"execution_count":18,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["prompt_df.to_csv(\"/content/drive/MyDrive/RL_for_LLMs/coqa_13b_few_shot_small.csv\")"],"metadata":{"id":"dRD2yO7RJTG1","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1711292771488,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":373,"user":{"displayName":"Jakob Schmitter","userId":"02815218098355940466"}}},"execution_count":19,"outputs":[]}]}
