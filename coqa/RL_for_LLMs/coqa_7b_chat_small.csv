But Cotton wasn't alone in her little home above the barn, oh no. She shared her hay bed with her mommy and 5 other sisters. All of her sisters were cute and fluffy, like Cotton. But she was the only white one in the bunch. The rest of her sisters were all orange with beautiful white tiger stripes like Cotton's mommy. Being different made Cotton quite sad. She often wished she looked like the rest of her family. So one day, when Cotton found a can of the old farmer's orange paint, she used it to paint herself like them. When her mommy and sisters found her they started laughing. 

""What are you doing, Cotton?!"" 

""I only wanted to be more like you"". 

Cotton's mommy rubbed her face on Cotton's and said ""Oh Cotton, but your fur is so pretty and special, like you. We would never want you to be any other way"". And with that, Cotton's mommy picked her up and dropped her into a big bucket of water. When Cotton came out she was herself again. Her sisters licked her face until Cotton's fur was all all dry. 

""Don't ever do that again, Cotton!"" they all cried. ""Next time you might mess up that pretty white fur of yours and we wouldn't want that!"" 

Then Cotton thought, ""I change my mind. I like being special"".

They took the note to Asta's papa. ""What does it say?"" they asked. 

Asta's papa read the note. He told Asta and Sharkie, ""This note is from a little girl. She wants to be your friend. If you want to be her friend, we can write a note to her. But you have to find another bottle so we can send it to her."" And that is what they did.

23,"My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. 

I know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. 

Her daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. 

I know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. 

Communication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. 

""Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,"" I insisted. ""I can hardly do dishes in return."" 

""Oh, no, Lucy."" Nicole said. ""Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it."" 

The doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. 

I am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. 

""Thank you"" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.

",an iPad,-0.7719528675079346
34,"My doorbell rings. On the step, I find the elderly Chinese lady, small and slight, holding the hand of a little boy. In her other hand, she holds a paper carrier bag. 

I know this lady. It is not her first visit. She is the boy's grandmother, and her daughter bought the house next door last October. 

Her daughter, Nicole, speaks fluent English. But she is now in Shanghai, and her parents are here with the little boy. Nicole has obviously told her mother that I am having heart surgery soon, so her mother has decided I need more nutrients. 

I know what is inside the bag--a thermos with hot soup and a stainless-steel container with rice, vegetables and either chicken, meat or shrimp, sometimes with a kind of pancake. This has become an almost-daily practice. 

Communication between us is somewhat affected by the fact that she doesn't speak English and all I can say in Chinese is hello. Once, she brought an iPad as well as the food. She pointed to the screen, which displayed a message from her daughter telling me that her mother wanted to know if the food was all right and whether it was too salty. I am not used to iPads, so she indicated I should go with her to her house. Then, she handed the iPad to her husband and almost immediately I found myself looking at Nicole in Shanghai and discussing her mother's cooking and salt intake. Instantly, tears welled in my eyes. 

""Your mother just can't be bringing me meals like this all the time,"" I insisted. ""I can hardly do dishes in return."" 

""Oh, no, Lucy."" Nicole said. ""Mum doesn't like western food. Don't worry about it; she has to cook for the three of them anyway, and she wants to do it."" 

The doorbell keeps ringing and there is the familiar brown paper carrier bag, handed smilingly to me. 

I am now working on some more Chinese words--it's the least I can do after such display of kindness. 

""Thank you"" is, of course, the first one. Somehow, it seems inadequate.

38,"(CNN) -- Dennis Farina, the dapper, mustachioed cop-turned-actor best known for his tough-as-nails work in such TV series as ""Law & Order,"" ""Crime Story,"" and ""Miami Vice,"" has died. He was 69. 

""We are deeply saddened by the loss of a great actor and a wonderful man,"" said his publicist, Lori De Waal, in a statement Monday. ""Dennis Farina was always warmhearted and professional, with a great sense of humor and passion for his profession. He will be greatly missed by his family, friends and colleagues."" 

Farina, who had a long career as a police officer in Chicago, got into acting through director Michael Mann, who used him as a consultant and cast him in his 1981 movie, ""Thief."" That role led to others in such Mann-created shows as ""Miami Vice"" (in which Farina played a mobster) and ""Crime Story"" (in which he starred as Lt. Mike Torello). 

Farina also had roles, generally as either cops or gangsters, in a number of movies, including ""Midnight Run"" (1988), ""Get Shorty"" (1995), ""The Mod Squad"" (1999) and ""Snatch"" (2000). 

In 2004, he joined the cast of the long-running ""Law & Order"" after Jerry Orbach's departure, playing Detective Joe Fontana, a role he reprised on the spinoff ""Trial by Jury."" Fontana was known for flashy clothes and an expensive car, a distinct counterpoint to Orbach's rumpled Lennie Briscoe. 

Farina was on ""Law & Order"" for two years, partnered with Jesse L. Martin's Ed Green. Martin's character became a senior detective after Farina left the show.

Its flag was later changed to reflect this. Staten Island has been sometimes called ""the forgotten borough"" by inhabitants who feel neglected by the city government. 

The North Shore—especially the neighborhoods of St. George, Tompkinsville, Clifton, and Stapleton—is the most urban part of the island; it contains the designated St. George Historic District and the St. Paul's Avenue-Stapleton Heights Historic District, which feature large Victorian houses. The East Shore is home to the F.D.R. Boardwalk, the fourth-longest in the world. The South Shore, site of the 17th-century Dutch and French Huguenot settlement, developed rapidly beginning in the 1960s and 1970s and is now mostly suburban in character.

94,"Thunder was coming when Reginald Eppes woke up at five in the morning. He checked the weather forecast. A violent storm was coming ,but it sounded like his small town wouldn't be hit too hard. But Eppes, a firefighter, had clearly known the power of these huge storms from experiences. ""Do you know where the flashlights are?"" he asked his wife. Danielle. Just then, thunder was all-around them. The moment he turned the flashlight on. The house lights went off. A second later, the kitchen windows were broken. Eppes and Danielle ran to their boys who were still sleeping in their bedroom. 

""Get up, get up, R.J.! "" Eppes shouted, waving his flashlight. The sleepy boy moved to the edge of the bed. Eppes held out his arms and ordered his son to jump. He was too late. The roof was torn down. R.J. was buried ,under the pieces. 

""I've lost him,"" Eppes thought. Quickly, he hurried to Joel to shield him. Glass, wood, and plaster ( ) hit them. Then something huge, heavy-maybe the washing machine-knocked into him. He hurt his arms, but he still held the flashlight in one hand. 

After a long period, the wind began to die down. Eppes found himself standing in the ruins of his home. Darkness lay all about him. Then he thought he saw a shape moving straight toward him. It was R.J., guided home by the light of his father's flashlight. 

At the hospital later, R.J. described what had happened to him. ""I rushed out when the wall started moving I was scared. My mom and dad were gone. Pieces of glass hit my back, and something hit my neck really hard. "" 

R.J. had been raised up into the air by the wind and dropped back to the ground. Amazingly, R.J. was not hurt badly. Of all his family, Eppes was hurt most seriously.
