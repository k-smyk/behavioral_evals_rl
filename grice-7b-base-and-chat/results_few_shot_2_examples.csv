Comment: I'm not sure I understand the question.

Comment: @user147311 I edited the question.

Answer: The correct answer is \em{I was not in the basement}.

The first sentence says that the speaker was in the laundry, and the second sentence says that the speaker was not in the basement.

The question is asking for the explicit answer to the question, which is \em{I was not in the basement}.

Comment: I think the OP is asking for the answer that is the most likely to be inferred from the question, not the explicit answer.

Comment: I'm not sure if this is a duplicate, but it seems to be related: [Is it possible to create an NLP task that is similar to the Turing Test?](https://stackoverflow.com/q/46921564/2227743)

Comment: I don't think it's a duplicate. The question is about the question itself, not about the answer.

Answer: I think that the answer is ""I was not in the laundry"" (or ""I was not in the crawlspace""), because it's the only one that's not an answer to the question.

The other options are all answers to the question, or are implicating that the answer is yes.
